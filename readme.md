# UI mod to introduce a Gesture to delete commands

This UI mod adds a basic gesture detection to allow you to delete commands while in command mode. This is in particular useful when you do not use hotkeys. Often I find myself in the situation that I miss placed a build order. When you do not use hotkeys, this looks like:

- (0) Miss click a build order.
- (1) Right click to cancel command mode.
- (2) Right click to remove the build order.
- (3) Move mouse to the correct build icon and left-click it.

In particular, step 3 can be time consuming. With this feature it can be simplified to:

- (0) Miss click a build order.
- (1) Rage-move the mouse across the build order until it disappears.

And problem solved. See it also in action:
